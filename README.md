# DNA-string-Complement_and_GC_content

This weeks assignment covers the fundamnetal concepts in Python to manipulate and operate on strings (that we have seen so far). There are two problems in this asignment:

1. Generate the reverse complementary sequence (opposite strand) for a given DNA string (**use string reversing option and dictionary**)

2. Compute the GC content of the given unknown DNA strings and identify the name of the gene and the organism from which the sequence was obtained (**use NCBI-BLAST**).

For both problems submit the appropriate python codes as .py files. Only for problem 2 submit an additional .doc/.pdf file containing the answers for the questions.

Adding # comments to explain your is highly recommended as it will help you as well the readers to understand the code and subsequently debug them if there is any issues with it.

The URL for this assignment needs to be submitted on or before 10-03-2020.
